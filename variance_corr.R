#Inferences
#1. Weekly_Sales is positively correlated to all features, except temperature.
#   This might tell us that as the temperature increases, people are more likely to stay inside and 
#   not go for shopping.

#2.  Weekly_Sales is positively correlated to Holidays, since more people will go
#   outside during holidays for shopping.

#3. Consumer Price Index is one of the measures for inflation.
#   We can see that CPI and unemployment are negatively correlated.
#   This is because if unemployment is low, employers typically need to pay 
#   leading to rising in wage inflation.
